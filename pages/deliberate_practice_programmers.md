# Deliberate practice for programmers

In order to define what deliberate practice is, in my understanding, let's look at the example of a guitar player.
The goal for her is to beautifully play a piece of music.
However, it's not efficient to practice by playing the same piece in one go, over and over again.
Instead, she must break down the act of playing into the difficult sub-problems that it consists of, 
and purposefully practice and perfect each of them, at increasing levels of difficulty.
For example, she could separately practice specific chord transitions in the left hand;
picking patterns in the right hand; or short melodies combining finger placement and picking.
Deliberately practicing the difficult steps is far more efficient than trying to practice everything at once.

There is lots of content [on the web](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=deliberate+practice)
about deliberate practice, how to define it and its benefits.
However, it was not obvious to me how I could leverage it as a programmer to improve my skills.
Of course, I get better each day by solving new problems, reading technical material and following other people's code.
This is very important, but I would not count that as deliberate practice.
Instead, here are some suggestions for deliberate practice that I have found to be beneficial for my programming skills:


## Finger training: learn to type better

Programmers type, all the time.
The faster you type and the less errors you make, the faster you will be able to realize your ideas in code.
Also, being able to type well takes away some of the reluctance you might feel when refactoring or re-writing
parts of your code base.
Even if you touch-type fairly well when writing regular text, you might not be really good at touch-typing all the symbols
and numbers. But those appear quite often when coding. 

I practiced touch typing for around 20 minutes a day, for 2-3 months (and repeated this after a year).
This turned out to be quite beneficial for my daily work.
There are many typing trainers available, both online and as desktop apps.
I liked [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/) for its nice UI and extensive training programs
(though, not being geared towards programmers specifically, I would have liked more exercises on numbers and symbols).


## Know your tools

Modern IDEs (integrated development environments) and editors offer a wide range of functionality to help you code better and faster.
I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as my IDE with [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) keybindings via [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim),
but this also applies to other toolsets.
You can only fully benefit from your tools if you know what they can do and if you know when and how to use them.
Examples:

* PyCharm has great functionality for refactoring, like changing a function name and automatically updating all references.
  This can save you a lot of time - but only if you know that it exists and how to use it.
* I know people who write Python code and debug with ``print`` and ``exit`` statements, even when working inside a modern IDE.
  Yes, sometimes this might work, but often a good visual debugger greatly speeds up your development.
* Vim has so many useful features that you will never stop learning. Do you write HTML? Then the ``cit`` sequence might
  come in handy - change the content of a tag (``cit`` = Change In Tag). 
* Keyboard shortcuts: learn them, practice them, as many as possible.
  
The message is: deliberately get to know your tools and practice using them.
Watch 'advanced' tutorials, read manuals and read help pages, read [books](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim).
Keep a list of useful features that you discover.
Then, every day or so, pick a feature from the list in the morning and try to use it throughout the day.

(Also, there is [VimGolf](https://www.vimgolf.com)! ;-) )


## Code Katas

[Code Katas](http://codekata.com/) are short programming exercises designed for deliberate practice.
They are short and fun (well, at least to passionate coders...).
It is also useful to do the same Kata multiple times, trying to come up with different solutions and thinking 
about the pros and cons of each.

I did Katas for a while, you can check out my solutions [on GitHub](https://github.com/ehansis/dojo).
One motivation was to get better at [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), 
but I also learned a lot of other things.
Besides, a Kata can be a nice break from regular coding work or a nice routine to start your day.

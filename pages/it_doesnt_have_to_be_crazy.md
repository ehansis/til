# It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work

I have been enjoying work quite a lot for the past two years.
And now I can better tell you, why!

I just finished reading ["It doesn't have to be crazy at work"](https://basecamp.com/books/calm)
by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com).
This book spells out their principles for running a calm, healthy company with calm, healthy employees.
As it turns out, we have been following a similar line of thought at Vebeto, in many respects.
Yet, reading these ideas written down in a book raised my awareness of their importance.
And it reminded me that working at a calm company is not the normal (unfortunately) but a privilege.

Here are some ideas from the book that particularly resonated with me, partly in their words and partly in mine:


### 8 is enough, 40 is plenty

Working 40 hours a week is enough, less is often fine, too.
Time in the office often feels short because it is sliced up into many small bits.
Uninterrupted 8 hours of work actually feel very long.
If you can't fit everything into 40 hours a week, you need to get better at picking what you do.
And when work can sometimes claim hours after 5pm or on the weekend, life can also 
claim hours on weekdays before 5pm.

There is so much more to life than work.
Put in a good day's work, day after day, but nothing more.
Creativity, progress and impact do not yield to brute force, anyway.


### Have less to do

The only way to get more done is to have less to do.
Peter Drucker said: "There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should
not be done at all."


### Our goal: No goals

Goals are fake. It would be strange to pretend that we cared about a number we just made up.
You can run a great business without a single goal.
You don't need something fake to do something real.

We make things better all the time, but we don't maximize 'better' by chasing imaginary goals.
We don't need to squeeze every drop out of the lemon.
Nothing ever stops at the 'quarterly win'.
Meeting goals often means making cultural compromises to get there that we rather wouldn't want to make otherwise.

If you still want to have goals, try the following: stay in business; serve your customers well;
build a delightful place to work at.


### Comfy is cool

If something feels uncomfortable at work, that often tells you that there is something amiss.
Listen to your level of (un)comfort.


### Protect your time

Meetings should be a measure of last resort.
Meetings with more than three people should be the extreme exception.
Taking other people's time for a meeting ought to feel painful.

Use asynchronous means of communication (e.g. written weekly status reports) instead of
meetings and other forms of immediate communication.


### Don't be a knee-jerk

The usual process for a company-internal pitch is as follows: The presenter carefully prepares
what they wants to say; they call a meeting; they give their presentation.
Immediately afterwards, the audience reacts, without any careful deliberation or care.

The wiser approach: The presenter writes up their idea and sends it out for consideration.
After a couple of days and careful deliberation (!), peers send back written (!) feedback.


### Launch and learn

Interviews, research and beta tests only give you simulated answers.
Launching and observing the market is the only way to get true answers.

# Deliberate practice for programmers

Deliberate practice is an indispensable tool when striving to master a profession.
In order to define what deliberate practice is, in my understanding, let's look at the example of a guitar player.
The end result that she wants to get to is to beautifully play a piece of music.
However, it's not efficient to practice by playing the same piece of music in one go, over and over again.
Instead, she must break down the act of playing into the difficult sub-problems that it consists of, 
and purposefully practice and perfect each of them, at increasing levels of difficulty.
For example, she could separately practice specific chord transitions in the left hand;
picking patterns in the right hand; or short melodies combining finger placement and picking.

There is lots of content [on the web](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=deliberate+practice)
about deliberate practice, how to define it and its benefits.
However, it was not obvious to me, how I could leverage it as a programmer to improve my skills.
Of course, I get better each day by solving new problems, following tutorials or reading other people's code.
This is very important, but I would not count that as deliberate practice.
Instead, here are some suggestions for deliberate practice I have found to be beneficial for my programming skills:


## Finger training: learn to type better

Programmers type, all the time.
The faster you type and the less errors you make, the faster you will be able to realize your ideas in code.
Also, being able to type well takes away some of the reluctance you might feel when refactoring or re-writing
parts of your code base.
Even if you touch-type fairly well when writing regular text, you might not be really good at typing all the symbols
and numbers. But those you need a lot when coding. 

I practiced touch typing for around 20 minutes a day, for 2-3 months (repeated this after a year), and found
that to be very beneficial for my daily work.
There are many different typing trainers, both online and as desktop apps.
I liked [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/) for its nice UI and extensive training programs
(though, not being geared towards programmers specifically, I would have liked more exercises on numbers and symbols).


## Know your tools

Modern IDEs (integrated development environments) and editors offer a wide range of functionality to help you code better and faster.
I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as my IDE with [VIM](https://www.vim.org/) keybindings via [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim),
but this also applies to other toolsets.
You can only fully benefit from this functionality if you know what it can do and if you know when and how to use it.
Examples:

* PyCharm has great functionality for refactoring, like changing a function name and automatically updating all references.
  This can save you a lot of time - but only if you know that it exists and how to use it.
* I know many people who write Python code and debug with ``print`` and ``exit`` statements, even when working inside a modern IDE.
  Yes, sometimes this might work, but often a good visual debugger greatly speeds up your development.
* VIM has so many useful features that you will never stop learning. Do you write HTML? Then the ``cit`` sequence might
  come in handy - change the content of a tag (Change In Tag). Also, there is [VimGolf](www.vimgolf.com)!
* Keyboard shortcuts: learn them, practice them, as many as possible.
  
The upshot is: deliberately get to know your tools and practice using them.
Watch 'advanced' tutorials, read manuals, read help sections.
I like to keep lists of useful features that I stumble upon.
Then, every couple of days I will pick a feature from the list in the morning and try to use it throughout the day.
This would probably be the deliberate practice part.


## Code Katas

[Code Katas](http://codekata.com/) are short programming exercises designed for deliberate practice in
specific aspects of programming.
They are short and fun (well, at least to passionate coders...).
It is also useful to do them several times, trying to come up with different solutions and thinking 
about the pros and cons of each.

I did Katas for a while, you can check out my output [on GitHub](https://github.com/ehansis/dojo).
One motivation was to get better at [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), 
but I also learned a lot of other things.
Besides, a Kata can be a nice break from regular coding work or a nice routine to start your day.

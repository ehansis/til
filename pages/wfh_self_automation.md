# If Nobody is Watching, Will You Self-Automate?

You are sitting idly in the office. Your boss is passing by and asking you what your doing right now.
You answer: Nothing, actually, because I have automated my job.

Sounds a bit scary, right? 
Automating parts your own job might relieve you from drudgery, increase your job satisfaction, [improve the quality of your work](automatic_quality.md) and
promote innovation. But should you try to self-automate, 
and [should you tell your boss](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/93696/is-it-unethical-for-me-to-not-tell-my-employer-i-ve-automated-my-job) if you do?
After all, she is paying you for hours worked, not for number of typo-free spreadsheets produced!

I don't have a good answer to those questions,
but I have a different question instead: Could this change, now that many more people are working from home?
The time saved by automating the spreadsheet, you can immediately direct that towards more important aspects of your life, while the
risk of being "caught" by your boss is greatly reduced.
In the end, less in-office surveillance (real or imaginary) could help change the way we measure "work", away from hours spent and towards the actual results.
This would make life quite a bit more complicated for bosses and HR people:
It's much harder to pay me based on the quality of my code than based on the time I spent hunched over my keyboard.
(And measuring "working hours" has been practiced since the start of the industrial age.)
But for some employees, the increased autonomy that comes with working from home
might be turned into an increase in productivity and quality of life, with automation as the enabling tool.

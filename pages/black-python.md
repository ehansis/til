# Just make it black: stop worrying about Python code formatting

[Black](https://github.com/psf/black) is a tool that calls itself 'the uncompromising Python code formatter'.
And I would not want to miss it any more.

Black formats your code according to strict rules, while making sure that the code's behaviour doesn't change.
Since I discovered it, I have hardly spent any time formatting my code.

Running Black on the current source file is mapped to a keyboard shortcut in my IDE (``Cmd+Ctrl+B``, if you wanted to know), and
I run it every time I have finished a block of code or a specific change. 
Running it has become so much of a habit that I often catch myself trying to run it on TeX, Markdown or JavaScript.
Still, I opt for running it manually instead of automatically on saving, because automatic reformatting of code might, 
for example, interfere with debugging sessions.

I find it tremendously liberating that I am practically unable to format the code manually.
This way, I can completely focus on the content.
This might sound trivial, but try it for a while and I hope that you become as attached (addicted?) to it as I am.

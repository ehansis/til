# Automatic Quality

Following the media on the topic of automation in the past couple of years, it would be understandable if you were a bit confused.
Either [robots will take all our jobs](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/robots-take-our-jobs-amazon-go-seattle),
or [they won't](https://www.wired.com/2017/08/robots-will-not-take-your-job/), or they were just 
[becoming our bosses](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155254/automation-robots-unemployment-jobs-vs-human-google-amazon),
and the covid-19 pandemic [also plays a role](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/07/30/the-fear-of-robots-displacing-workers-has-returned).
My takeaway from this: It's hard to predict, nobody knows.

The discussion on automation often focuses on saving labor costs, the associated job losses 
and which industries and occupations might be affected most.
Those are very important questions.

This post is on an aspect of automation that is sometimes mentioned but, I think, deserves more attention:
**Automation can improve quality**.
I'm not necessarily talking about automation on the scale of robots building cars. 
We can start at a lower level of automation, being introduced into our everyday computerized work life.


## Just the right amount

Computers (as of today) excel mainly at dumb, repetitive tasks.
These they carry out with an unparalleled level of accuracy.
Humans have very different skills.
Striking the right balance in automation is crucial, dividing up labor appropriately between humans and computers.

Here is an example: Imagine that you go to a hospital, and for the check-in procedure there is an automated system
that helps you fill out forms.
You type your name and birth date once and the system (maybe without you knowing it) fills that information into
20 different databases and subsystems.
That's neat, right? Or would you rather type your name 20 times?
Probably not, and it would greatly increase the probability of typos, causing your lab results to not show up because you mis-typed your date of birth once.
After checking in, you have the option to either see a doctor or to describe your symptoms to an automated system and get an automated diagnosis.
I assume that you would prefer the former, because you feel that human compassion and intuition are a very important part of the diagnostic process.

Here is another example: You request a bank statement in your online banking system.
An employee of the bank messages you back, thanking you for the request and politely asking you to wait for 15 minutes.
During that time, he will look up all the relevant activity in the bank's database,
reading numbers from his database terminal and typing them into your statement.
Would you trust that bank statement (and the bank, for that matter)?
Now imagine asking your financial institution for help with structuring your personal finances.
Sure, they say, here's a web page - fill out the forms and it will spit out your personal finance plan for the next 20 years.
Maybe you'd like that, or maybe not, because you would expect a human to be better suited to discuss with you all those different
variables and eventualities that matter for long-term financial planning.


## Just the wrong amount

I don't often see examples of over-automation in the wild*.
Probably, one reason is that companies get rapid feedback that customers and employees don't like it.
Another might be that over-automating requires explicit investment, so the costs are readily visible.

However, I frequently see examples of under-automation: names typed into administrative forms multiple times, 
numbers transcribed manually from one system into another, columns pushed around spreadsheets.
These are frustrating activities and extremely error-prone.
And they are costly as well, but the costs are hidden: foregone productivity, annoyed customers/employees and 
hunting down of errors after the fact.

*(One exception is the voice robot that picks up the phone at Deutsche Telekom's customer service hotline, which
asks many questions, doesn't understand many answers and is so very annoying!)


## Tested qualities

Obviously, automation is not a panacea for achieving good quality.
Automation lets you do things at scale, including making mistakes.
However, it gives you the chance to make some mistakes just once and rule them out going forward,
as you implement the corrected process including [automated tests](three_levels_analytics_testing.md).

I would guess, though, that the most important quality aspect of automation is the simplest: computers don't do typos.

(Here is an [article on famous typos](https://www.six-degrees.com/the-high-cost-of-small-mistakes-the-most-expensive-typos-of-all-time/),
off-topic and for entertainment purposes only.)


## You, Robot

If you look at your day-to-day work, I would be surprised if you didn't find activities that would benefit from automation,
reducing your load of menial tasks and improving the quality of your work at the same time.
Many software packages offer some form of automation, like macros in spreadsheet programs.

However, if you are serious about getting your computer to work for you, acquiring some coding skills will definitely pay off.
A good starting point is the book ["Automate the boring stuff with Python"](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.
The book free to read online - scroll down on the page to find the list of chapters (and please order a copy if you would like to support the project).
It's quite a thrill to see the computer do something useful for you, something you told it to do!

If you are working in an IT/data/geek function already, there's no excuse for you not to try and automate your work as far as possible.
This might require ditching some pointy-clicky proprietary tools in favor of open, scriptable ones, and to find automation work-arounds in some places.
But, you will thank yourself for it, and so will your colleagues and customers.
